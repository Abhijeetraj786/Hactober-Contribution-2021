# Hactober-Contribution-2021
This is used to contribute for the open source and help the open source comitte to grow more.
The main aim of this repo is to  make beginners learn about open source contribution in a very encouraging way by making them win Hactoberfest _2021 t-shirts.
This is not my repo but I add things.
